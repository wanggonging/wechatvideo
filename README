Quick start:

* Have a relatively good PC (less than 3 years old, with 1TB HD and good amount of memory - otherwise encoding video might be a bit slow, SSD not required). Install latest Ubuntu, and clone this repo.
* Buy Linux VPS with root access (search how mainland Chinese buy VPS to use shadowsocks for GFW bypass) and choose latest Ubuntu (16 or 17) as the OS for your VPS. This will roughly cost 5-10$/month per server. Start with one and once there are enough load you can add more.
* Obtain your YouTube google API key for free at Google Developer Console: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im69kzhpR3I
* Review and update globals.sh with your server address and google api key
* Generate your ssh key with ssh-keygen, and review/update server.sh
  run this if you don't want to read server.sh:
	cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/authorized_keys
* provision your server(s) with: ./server.sh <server_ip>
* ./yt2.sh boot	     ## install all dependencies, you need to supply password for sudo
* ./yt2.sh one YP    ## try with one channel to see how things go
* ./yt2.sh all       ## if everything works, you can let it do all channels in a loop
* If the above works, you should be able to access your server IP address using
any browser and see the video index page.
